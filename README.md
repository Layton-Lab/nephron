# About
This is latest version of sex-specific mathematical models for epithelial transport along the nephron implemented in Python 3. This includes the normal pregnancy study. Related research papers are listed below. Please cite appropriately. To speed up the computation time, parallel computation of different types of nephron is implemented for the multiple nephron model. 

# Instructions
To run the parallel simulation code use command: **python3 parallel_simulate.py --sex [option] --species [option] --type [option] --diabetes [option] --inhibition [option] --pregnant [option]**

The options here are:

sex: **Male, Female** (required);

species: **human, rat, mouse** (required);

type: **superficial, multiple** (required);

diabetes: **Severe, Moderate, Non** (optional, default: Non);

pregnant: **mid, late** (optional, default: non, only for female rat);

inhibition: **ACE, SGLT2, NHE3-50, NHE3-80, NKCC2-70, NKCC2-100, NCC-70, NCC-100, ENaC-70, ENaC-100, SNB-70, SNB-100** (optional, default: None).

unx: **N, Y** (optional, default: N)

Notes:
* Human only have ACE and SGLT2 inhibition cases. The others are for rats.
* pregnancy: only has been characterized for normal pregnant rat superficial nephron at this time (i.e., not done for humans and for diabetes, also multiple nephron)
* mouse model is not finished for any case

### Understanding output

All the output files' names are in following structure: 'sex_species_segment_concentration/flow_of_solute_in_compartment.txt'. 

Here is an example: female_rat_ccd_con_of_Cl_in_Bath.txt. It contains interstitial concentration of Chloride along cortical collecting duct in female rat.

Another example: male_hum_pt_flow_of_Na_in_Lumen.txt. It contains luminal flow of Sodium along proximal convolute tubule in male human.

These results are scaled per nephron.

The unit of concentration from outputs is **mmol/L (mM)**.

The unit of volume is **nl/min**.

The unit of flow is **pmol/min**.

**/plot/** contains scripts for plotting output
